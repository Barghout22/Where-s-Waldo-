# Where's Luffy
This is a "where's Waldo" . The objective is locate a certain number of characters as quickly as possible to try and get a high score time.

This project is one of projects required through [The Oin Project curriculum]().Here is the link to the [specific project lesson]().

I completed this project using Create React App with functional components and Typescript.
I also used firebase for the backend to save all users scores and compared them to one another and display them.
