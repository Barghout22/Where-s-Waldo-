# Where's Luffy

## Overview

This is a "where's Waldo" . The objective is locate a certain number of characters as quickly as possible to try and get a high score time.

This project is one of projects required through [The Oin Project curriculum]().Here is the link to the [specific project lesson]().

## Tools

I completed this project using Create React App with functional components and Typescript.
I also used firebase for the backend to save all users scores ,reload them every session and display them in a scoreboard at the end of each game.

## Live Demo

the game is currently only functional on desktop.

The game is live [here](http://barghout22.github.io/Wheres-Luffy).
